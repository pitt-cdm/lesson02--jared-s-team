# Modularity Document

## Things we've seen Modularity in:
* Microsoft Word - can add multiple shapes/pictures onto a page and then group them together and move them as one within a textbook or just on the page in general
* Microsoft Powerpoint - can add shapes and pictures to powerpoint and move them together or as one
* Photoshop - Each image had multiple different layers to it that can all be added or removed while editing the photo
* Slideshows- These can include images, text, and even sound depending on where it's presented.
