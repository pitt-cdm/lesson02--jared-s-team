# Modularity Document

## Things we've seen Modularity in:
* Microsoft Word - can add multiple shapes/pictures onto a page and then group them together and move them as one within a textbook or just on the page in general
* Microsoft Powerpoint 
* Photoshop
* Slideshows- These can include images, text, and even sound depending on where it's presented.
